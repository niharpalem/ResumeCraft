    As an expert resume analyst, create a comprehensive optimization strategy for the given JSON resume data to match the job description. Your task:

    1. Parse the JSON resume thoroughly, extracting all key sections: work experience, skills, education, and projects.
    2. Map resume sections directly to job description requirements.
    3. Identify exact skill and experience matches.
    4. Determine the most relevant professional experiences.
    5. Create a targeted alignment strategy.
    6. Suggest relevant keywords from the job description to be added where appropriate.
    7. Propose a new arrangement of sections (especially projects and skills) to better match the job description.

    Important: Do not remove any information from the original JSON data. Instead, focus on rearranging and enhancing the content.

    Resume Data:
    {json.dumps(json_data)}

    Job Description:
    {job_description}

    Provide a structured, data-driven optimization strategy, including:
    1. Skill overlap percentage
    2. Recommended content modifications
    3. Suggested keyword additions
    4. Proposed section rearrangement
    5. A 3-line summary (tailored to the role):
       â†’ This is the candidate's elevator pitch. Highlight their biggest achievements and skills that prove they're the right fit for the role. Make it sound natural, as if the candidate wrote it themselves. Be formal but conversational. Don't mention specific company names.

    For the summary, focus on making it sound authentic, human, and tailored to the specific role. Use the candidate's voice and perspective.

    Additionally, suggest how to consolidate skills sections if there are multiple, aiming for about 5 main categories under skills. Don't combine all sections, but identify opportunities to group related skills effectively.

    Emphasize the importance of keywords throughout the optimization strategy.
